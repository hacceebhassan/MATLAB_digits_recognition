Digits Recognition using HAM (Neural Network)

## Network Architecture
A Hopfield Network has the following architecture:\
◮ Recurrent network, weights Wij\
◮ Symmetric weights, i.e. Wij= Wji\
◮ All neurons can act as input units and all units are output units\
◮ It’s a dynamical system (more precisely “attractor network”):\
◮ It’s possible to store memory items in the weights W of the network and use it as associative memory

## Pros:
◮ Very simple model\
◮ Nice mathematical analysis possible (also for capacity)

## Cons:
◮ Dynamics of the system are constrained to fixed points\
◮ No storage of time series\
◮ Low capacity

## How to Run File
Open the "script.m" file and run it on MATLAB
